## Motivation

Trust me, changing your career is not simple! Guidance and advice are always welcome, but they are even better when coming from someone who was/is in a similar situation as yours. Building a concept for a social network where people making similar career changes can exchange ideas was the primary motivation behind this project. Also, I thought that making such a project would be a good to practice my skills.

## Mainly used technologies

- Prior to this project, I didnâ€™t use **react-hooks** extensively, this was an opportunity to practice them. I also used r**eact-router** for routing. I used **redux** for global state management.
- I handled the back-end with **firebase**. It is used for email authentication as well as database for posts, comments, messages and notifications.

## What can be improved ?

- This is currently a client-side app. It is probably better to have it rendered on the server. This would be a good opportunity for me to try server-side-rendering with next.js.
