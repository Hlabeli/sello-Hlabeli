## Motivation

I built the first version of this website using create-react-app. I wanted later to make the website faster by using a static site generator. I tried Gatsby and Next.js and finally went with the latter. The old version was practically a resume page. I added the about and projects pages. Although the information in the /resume can overlap with the ones in /about, I kept it so far as it is more detailed and with a more structural presentation.

## Mainly used technologies

- As mentioned earlier, I built this website with **Next.js** to benefit from the static site generation.
- I used **tailwind-CSS** for styling.
- The /about and the /projects/ pages are written in markdown parsed with **remark**.

## I will add

- I will probably set up a **blog** where I can share my thoughts and experiences.
- I know a thing or two about **machine learning**, so I might add a page dedicated to showcasing small ML projects and ideas.
