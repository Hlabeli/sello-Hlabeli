## Motivation

I made this web application (Dashboard) with a team of 4 members at Zeecom Technologies using Laravel framework. It was a bit challenging during the development stage because I had to learn laravel framework once again (reason being the gap year a took without using a laravel in any of the projects I was involved in) and develop the application at the same time but finally rewarding because the product first priority requirements were delivered successfully.

## Applications

- Matches: Authenticated users can create matches and add participants to the match.
- Searching capabilities: it displays records for a searched match/participant name.
- Download: Each match report can be dowloaded as a pdf.
- Dashboard: users or admin can captures the participantsâ€™ records in a gun shooting range and automate the rankings which are depended on the number of points attained by a participants at the end of the score sheet. The application provides soft delete features; which means that participants or matches can be deleted permanently and/or deleted and recovered (its something like trash in Mac or recycle bin in Windows).
- **Application url will not be given for security purposes but if you want to see the awesome web application/dashboard please kindly contacted me**
