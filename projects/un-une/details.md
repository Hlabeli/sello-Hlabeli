## Motivation

Feminine or masculine? That is the question you often ask yourself as a French learner. There are some rules, but there are always exceptions, and if you are like me, you will always end up guessing the opposite. If you are in a similar situation, this app can be useful for you ðŸ˜€
The idea came to my mind while implementing the dictionary app in my mac-os clone project, and I thought I could do it in a simple application with one task.

## Mainly used technologies

- At this stage I was quite familiar with **React functional components and hooks**. As it is a small app, I didnâ€™t see the need to incorporate a global state manager such as redux.
- I took this project as an opportunity to learn and practice using **Tailwind-CSS**.
- The api calls in the application are handled by **axios**.
- Later in the project, I added **Firebase** so that authenticated users can save searched words to their favorites.

## What can be improved/added ?

- Currently, the application returns results for correctly spelled words only. You could easily imagine that someone who doesnâ€™t know the gender of a noun wonâ€™t also know how to spell it correctly ðŸ˜œ. Thus, **word suggestions** when you type can be very helpful. Unfortunately, I did not find a free dictionary api that can be suitable for this task.
- If one day I decided to learn mobile applications development (why not), porting this project into a mobile app can be a good starting point.
